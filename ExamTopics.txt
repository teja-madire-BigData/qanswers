An online retailer needs to deploy a product sales reporting solution. The source data is exported from an external online transaction processing (OLTP) system for reporting. Roll-up data is calculated each day for the previous day's activities. The reporting system has the following requirements:
✑ Have the daily roll-up data readily available for 1 year.
✑ After 1 year, archive the daily roll-up data for occasional but immediate access.
✑ The source data exports stored in the reporting system must be retained for 5 years. Query access will be needed only for re-evaluation, which may occur within the first 90 days.
Which combination of actions will meet these requirements while keeping storage costs to a minimum? (Choose two.)

A. Store the source data initially in the Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage class. Apply a lifecycle configuration that changes the storage class to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive 90 days after creation, and then deletes the data 5 years after creation.

B. Store the source data initially in the Amazon S3 Glacier storage class. Apply a lifecycle configuration that changes the storage class from Amazon S3 Glacier to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive 90 days after creation, and then deletes the data 5 years after creation.

A central government organization is collecting events from various internal applications using Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK).
The organization has configured a separate Kafka topic for each application to separate the data. For security reasons, the Kafka cluster has been configured to only allow TLS encrypted data and it encrypts the data at rest.
A recent application update showed that one of the applications was configured incorrectly, resulting in writing data to a Kafka topic that belongs to another application. This resulted in multiple errors in the analytics pipeline as data from different applications appeared on the same topic. After this incident, the organization wants to prevent applications from writing to a topic different than the one they should write to.
Which solution meets these requirements with the least amount of effort?
A. Create a different Amazon EC2 security group for each application. Configure each security group to have access to a specific topic in the Amazon MSK cluster. Attach the security group to each application based on the topic that the applications should read and write to.
B. Install Kafka Connect on each application instance and configure each Kafka Connect instance to write to a specific topic only.
C. Use Kafka ACLs and configure read and write permissions for each topic. Use the distinguished name of the clients' TLS certificates as the principal of the ACL.
D. Create a different Amazon EC2 security group for each application. Create an Amazon MSK cluster and Kafka topic for each application. Configure each security group to have access to the specific cluster.

Once a new month begins, no new writes are made to any of the indices from the previous months. The company has been expanding the storage on the Amazon
OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) cluster to avoid running out of space, but the company wants to reduce costs. Most searches on the cluster are on the most recent 3 months of data, while the audit team requires infrequent access to older data to generate periodic reports. The most recent 3 months of data must be quickly available for queries, but the audit team can tolerate slower queries if the solution saves on cluster costs
Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to meet these requirements?
A. Archive indices that are older than 3 months by using Index State Management (ISM) to create a policy to store the indices in Amazon S3 Glacier. When the audit team requires the archived data, restore the archived indices back to the Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) cluster.

A data analytics specialist needs to implement a solution that aggregates the data in near-real time and saves the data to a persistent data store. The data must be stored in nested JSON format and must be queried from the data store with a latency of single-digit milliseconds.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to receive the data from the sensors. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to read the stream, aggregate the data, and send the data to an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to store the data in Amazon DynamoDB. Most Voted
B. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to receive the data from the sensors. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to aggregate the data. Use an AWS Lambda function to read the data from Kinesis Data Analytics and store the data in Amazon S3.
C. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to receive the data from the sensors. Use an AWS Lambda function to aggregate the data during capture. Store the data from Kinesis Data Firehose in Amazon DynamoDB.
D. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to receive the data from the sensors. Use an AWS Lambda function to aggregate the data during capture. Store the data in Amazon S3.

An ecommerce company ingests a large set of clickstream data in JSON format and stores the data in Amazon S3. Business analysts from multiple product divisions need to use Amazon Athena to analyze the data. The company's analytics team must design a solution to monitor the daily data usage for Athena by each product division. The solution also must produce a warning when a division exceeds its quota.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A. Use a CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) statement to create separate tables for each product division. Use AWS Budgets to track Athena usage. Configure a threshold for the budget. Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to send notifications when thresholds are breached.
B. Create an AWS account for each division. Provide cross-account access to an AWS Glue Data Catalog to all the accounts. Set an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to monitor Athena usage. Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to send notifications.
C. Create an Athena workgroup for each division. Configure a data usage control for each workgroup and a time period of 1 day. Configure an action to send notifications to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. 
D. Create an AWS account for each division. Configure an AWS Glue Data Catalog in each account. Set an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to monitor Athena usage. Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to send notifications.

An advertising company has a data lake that is built on Amazon S3. The company uses AWS Glue Data Catalog to maintain the metadata. The data lake is several years old and its overall size has increased exponentially as additional data sources and metadata are stored in the data lake. The data lake administrator wants to implement a mechanism to simplify permissions management between Amazon S3 and the Data Catalog to keep them in sync.
Which solution will simplify permissions management with minimal development effort?
A. Set AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions for AWS Glue
B. Use AWS Lake Formation permissions
C. Manage AWS Glue and S3 permissions by using bucket policies
D. Use Amazon Cognito user pools

ans:B------------------------------------------------------
